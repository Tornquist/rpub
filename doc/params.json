{"name":"Rpub","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nrPub is a command-line tool that generates a collection of plain text input\r\nfiles into an eBook in ePub format. It provides several related functions to\r\nmake working with ePub files a little easier:\r\n\r\n* Generation of table of contents\r\n* Tracking of references to tables or figures\r\n* Validation of output file\r\n* Packaging your eBook in an archive with additional README file\r\n* Very simple version control\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nrPub is distributed as a Ruby gem, which should be installed on most Macs and\r\nLinux systems. Once you have ensured you have a working installation of Ruby\r\nand Ruby gems, install the gem as follows from the command line:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install rpub\r\n\r\nYou can verify the gem has installed correctly by checking its version number:\r\n\r\n\r\n    $ rpub -v\r\n\r\nIf this generates an error, something has gone wrong. You should see something\r\nalong the lines of `rpub 1.0.0`.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n## Basics\r\n\r\nePubs are basically collections of HTML files, combined in a single archive\r\naccording to a set of predefined rules. rPub generates these files for you from\r\nsimple text files written in [Markdown][], a very readable markup language created\r\nby [John Gruber][]. This very README file is an example of a Markdown document.\r\n\r\nThe idea is you write several Markdown files using your favourite text editor,\r\nand save them as plain text in your project directory. Usually you would write\r\none file per chapter. By invoking the `rpub` program you convert those files to\r\nHTML and combine them in an ePub archive:\r\n\r\n    $ rpub compile\r\n    Generating my-new-book-0.1.0.epub... Done!\r\n\r\nAfter you have run the `rpub compile` command, you will find a new `.epub` file\r\nin your project directory. The name of this file depends on the title of your\r\nbook, and its version number. You can set these values, as well as a few others,\r\nin a special configuration file called `config.yml`:\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    author: Your Name\r\n    title: My new book\r\n    version: 0.1.0\r\n\r\nThis file is written in [YAML][] and sets basic properties of your book project.\r\n\r\nTo make sure the book you generated is _valid_ -- meaning it is likely that most\r\nreaders out there will be able to read it -- you can use the special `validate`\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n    $ rpub validate\r\n\r\nrPub will report any errors it finds. No output means everything is alright.\r\n\r\nSince regenerating your ePub file and opening it in a suitable reader\r\napplication is cumbersome, rPub can generate a simple preview document for you:\r\n\r\n    $ rpub preview\r\n\r\nThis will generate a new HTML file in your project directory with a name similar\r\nto your ePub file. This is the entire text of your book as a single web page for\r\neasy viewing in any browser.\r\n\r\n[Markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\r\n[John gruber]: http://daringfireball.net\r\n\r\n## Advanced features\r\n\r\n### Watching for changes\r\n\r\n### Packaging for distribution\r\n\r\n### Very simple version control\r\n\r\n### Automatic references\r\n\r\n### Automatic table of contents\r\n\r\n### Custom layout and styles\r\n\r\n## Command reference\r\n\r\n* `rpub compile` -- generate .epub file\r\n* `rpub package` -- create zip file with compiled book and other listed files\r\n* `rpub validate` -- compile, then validate\r\n* `rpub preview` -- generate preview HTML file\r\n* `rpub new` -- create skeleton directory tree\r\n* `rpub help` -- get help on subcommands\r\n* `rpub clean` -- remove generated files\r\n* `rpub release` -- package and tag in Git\r\n* `rpub snapshot` -- commit changes in git after validation\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nSee the [examples directory](examples) for two example projects.\r\n\r\n# Other\r\n\r\n## Note on Patches/Pull Requests\r\n\r\n1. Fork the project.\r\n2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version\r\n   unintentionally.\r\n4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have\r\n   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can\r\n   ignore when I pull)\r\n5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues, defects or suggestions in the [Github issue\r\ntracker](https://github.com/avdgaag/rpub/issues).\r\n\r\n## What has changed?\r\n\r\nSee the [HISTORY](HISTORY) file for a detailed changelog.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nCreated by: Arjan van der Gaag  \r\nURL: [http://arjanvandergaag.nl](http://arjanvandergaag.nl)  \r\nProject homepage: [http://avdgaag.github.com/rpub](http://avdgaag.github.com/rpub)  \r\nDate: april 2012  \r\nLicense: [MIT-license](LICENSE) (same as Ruby)\r\n","tagline":"an ePub generation library in Ruby","google":"UA-20357800-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
